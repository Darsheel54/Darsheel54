👋 Hi, I’m Darsheel — an 18-year-old developer passionate about building creative and interactive web experiences.
💻 I work with:
- 🌐 HTML, CSS, JavaScript — for crafting dynamic and responsive front-end designs
- 🐍 Python — for scripting, automation, and backend logic
- 🛢️ MySQL — for managing and querying relational databases
🚀 I love blending code with creativity, whether it's through animations, storytelling, or educational tools. Always learning, always building.
